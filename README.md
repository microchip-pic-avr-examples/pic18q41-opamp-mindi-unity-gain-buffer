# Getting started with MindiÂ® simulation and PIC18-Q41 microcontrollers
This guide will get you up and running with simulating the analog OPAMP module in PIC18-Q41 family devices using the Mindi simulation tool. **For more information about getting started with and using the MPLAB Mindi Analog Simulator please refer to the following resources:**

## Configuration: Unity Gain Buffer (Voltage Follower)
A unity gain buffer is an opamp configuration in which the output voltage tracks the input voltage, also known as a voltage follower.

### Mindi Simulation

Download and open the follower **Mindi schematic [here](schematics/Voltage_Follower.wxsch)**. Press the _play_ button to simulate with an example stimulus source.

### Adjustment Options
A voltage follower has no adjustable resistor values.

### Updating composer fields
Once the desired result has been verified with Mindi simulation, the corrected values should be moved back into MCC by copying resistor values across to the composer of your preference.

### Don't have Mindi?
